# Overview
Bloodhound is a tool used for finding relationships and patterns within data from an Active Directory environment. It is run on the attacker's machine and accessed through a web interface. Bloodhound operates on data and this data comes from a *collector* which is executed on the target machine.

# Setup
1. Install Bloodhound
```bash
sudo apt install bloodhound
```

2. Configure neo4j - Bloodhound relies on a different tool called neo4j. It is best to change its default credentials.
	- run neo4j
	```bash
	sudo neo4j console
	```
	- open the link it gives you and use the credentials neo4j:neo4j to login
	- change the password

# Collecting Data for Bloodhound
Data is obtain through a collector. There are different ones available. You can get SharpHound from the Bloodhound GitHub repo - https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/blob/master/Collectors/SharpHound.ps1.

Start neo4j and bloodhound:
```bash
sudo neo4j console
```
```bash
sudo bloodhound
```

Run the collector on the target machine:
```powershell
powershell -ep bypass
```
```powershell
. .\SharpHound.ps1
```
```powershell
Invoke-BloodHound -CollectionMethod All -Domain <domain> -ZipFileName <output file>
```

Now, move the files to the attacker machine.

# Viewing the Data
In Bloodhound, on the right you should see a button for `Upload Data`. Select the previously obtained zip file and wait for Bloodhound to process it.

In the top left, click on the three dashes and you should see a summary of the data imported:

# Finding Relationships in the Data
Through the analysis tab, you can see a bunch of pre-made queries. Their names are usually self-describing. Clicking on any of them will generate a particular graph expressing a specific relationship within the AD environment:

You are also able to create custom queries.
