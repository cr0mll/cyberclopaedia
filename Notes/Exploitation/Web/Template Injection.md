# Overview
Template Injection occurs when an attacker injects malicious template code into an input field and the templating engine doesn't sanitise the input. As such, the expression provided by the attacker may be evaluated and can lead to all sorts of nasty vulnerabilities such as RCE.

# Server-Side Template Injection
SSTI occurs when the injection happens on the server-side. Templating engines are associated with different programming languages, so you might be able to execute code in that language when SSTI occurs.

Testing for SSTI is template engine-dependent because different engines make use of a different syntax. It is, however, common to see templates enclosed in two pairs of `{{}}`. 

You should look for places in a webpage where user input is reflected. If you inject `{{7*'7'}}` and see `49` or `7777777` somewhere, then you know you have SSTI. This syntax isn't standard. You will need to identify the running template engine and use the correct syntax.

# Client-Side Template Injection
This vulnerability occurs in client template engines, which are written in Javascript. Such engines are Google's AngularJS and Facebook's ReactJS.

CSTI typically occur in browser, so they typically cannot be used for RCE, but may be exploited for XSS. This can be difficult, since most engines do a good job at sanitising input and preventing XSS.

When interacting with ReactJS, you should look for `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` function calls where you can modify the input. This function intentionally bypasses React's XSS protections.

AngularJS versions before 1.6 include a sandbox in order to limit the available Javascript functions, but bypasses have been found. You can check the AngularJS version by typing `Angular.version` in the developer console. A list of bypasses can be found at https://pastebin.com/xMXwsm0N, however, more are surely available online.
