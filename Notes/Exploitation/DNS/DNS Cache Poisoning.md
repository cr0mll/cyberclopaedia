# Introduction
A flaw of all DNS name servers is that if they contain incorrect information, they may spread it to clients or other name servers. Each DNS name server (even individual clients) has a DNS cache. The system stores there information about any responses it gets for domains it requested. An attacker could inject false entries in this cache and as such, any computer which queries the poisoned name server will receive false results. This is known as *DNS cache poisoning*. 

The attack can be used to redirect users to a different website than the requested one. As such, it opens opportunities for phishing attacks by creating evil twins of login portals for well-known sites.

A tool for performing such targeted attacks is [deserter](https://github.com/b4ckslash0/deserter). Usage information is available on its GitHub page.
