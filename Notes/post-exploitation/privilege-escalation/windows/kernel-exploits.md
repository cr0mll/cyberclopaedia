# Introduction
Kernel exploits are one of the most trivial privilege escalation paths available. One of the first things you should do when seeking for a privilege escalation vector is to look at the kernel version as well as any installed patches and determine if it is vulnerable to a known kernel exploit. 

Plenty of exploits can be found just by searching up the kernel version, but a cheat sheet which I like can be found [here](https://github.com/SecWiki/windows-kernel-exploits).

Naturally, the exploitation of a kernel exploit is highly specific on a case-by-case basis. Once you have identified that the system is vulnerable to a known kernel exploit, you will need to find the exploit code.
