# Sudo Escalation via LD\_PRELOAD

The `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable can be used to tell the dynamic linker to load [specific libraries](../../../reverse-engineering/binary-formats/index/dynamic-linking.md) before any others.

By default, programmes run with `sudo` will be executed in a clean, minimal environment which is specified by `env_reset` when running `sudo -l`. However, `env_keep` may be used to inherit some environment variables from the parent process.

If `LD_PRELOAD` is specified together with `env_keep`, then we can compile our own malicious dynamic library and set `LD_PRELOAD` to it. Therefore, when we execute a binary with `sudo`, our library will be loaded before any other library and its initialisation function will be invoked with root permissions.

## Writing the Malicious Library

Writing the library is a fairly simple task. All we need to do is write an `_init` function in a C file. This procedure will contain the code we want to be executed when the library is loaded.

```cpp
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void _init()
{
	unsetenv("LD_PRELOAD"); // Unset LD_PRELOAD to avoid an infinite loop
	setgid(0); // Set root permissions
	setuid(0); // Set root permissions
	
	system("/bin/bash");
}

```

We begin by unsetting the `LD_PRELOAD` variable from the environment. This is to preclude an infinite loop when `/bin/bash` is invoked. If our library didn't unset `LD_PRELOAD`, then when `/bin/bash` is called, our library will again be loaded first and then proceed onto launching `/bin/bash` yet again, which will again load our library and so on.

The next two lines set the user and group IDs to those of `root` which ensures that the next commands are run with root privileges.

Finally, `system` is called in order to spawn a bash shell.

We now need to compile this file as a shared library:

```bash
gcc -fPIC -shared -o exploit.so exploit.c -nostartfiles
```

At last, we can invoke any binary with `sudo` and specify the path to our library as `LD_PRELOAD`. Note that the path to the library must be specified as an absolute path.
