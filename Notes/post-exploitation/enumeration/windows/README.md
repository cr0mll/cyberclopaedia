# Introduction
Plenty of automated tools can be found for enumerating Windows machines. They are a bit more diverse than those available for Linux - there are precompiled binaries (`.exe`s) available, but there are also PowerShell scripts and many more.

## Windows Enumeration with WinPEAS
[WinPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/winPEAS) is an incredible tool for enumerating Windows machines. It comes in two flavours - `.bat` and `.exe`. It doesn't really matter which one you are going to run - both will do the job just fine - however, the `.exe` file requires `.Net` version 4.5.2 or later to be installed on the machine.

Enumerating system information:
```sh
winpeas.exe systeminfo
```
