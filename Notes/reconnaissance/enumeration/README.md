# Overview
Network scanning is the process of gathering information about a target via comlex reconnaissance techniques. The term "network scanning" refers to the procedures used for discovering hosts, ports, running services and information about the underlying OS type.

## Types of scanning
### Port Scanning
Lists the open ports and the services running on them. Port scanning describes the process of querying the running services on a computer by sending a stream of messages in an attempt to identify the service in question, as well as any information related to it. It involves probing TCP and UDP ports of a target system in order to determine if a service is running / listening.

### Network Scanning
This is the process of discovering active hosts on a network, either for attacking them or assessing the overall network security.

### Vulnerability Scanning
Reveals the presence of known vulnerabilities. It checks whether a system is exploitable through a set of weaknesses. Such a scanner consists of a catalog and a scanning engine. The catalog contains information about known vulnerabilities and exploits for them that work on a multitude of servers. The scanning engine is responsible for the logic behind the exploitation and analysis of the results.
