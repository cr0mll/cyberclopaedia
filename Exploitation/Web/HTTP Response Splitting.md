# Introduction
HTTP Response Splitting occurs when user-provided input isn't sanitised and CRLFs are injected into HTTP responses. This is usually done through URL parameters. This type of attack typically requires social engineering or at least some user interaction.

HTTP responses consist of message headers and a message body. The headers are separated from the body with 2 CRLFs - `\r\n\r\n`. An attacker could inject this character sequence into a header and terminate the header section - this could result in XSS, since anything after the 2 CRLFs will be treated as HTML.

Imagine a custom header `X-Name: Bob` which is set via a parameter in a `GET` request called `name`. If input isn't properly sanitised, an attacker could craft the following URL which would result in XSS:

```html
?name=Bob%0d%0a%0d%0a<script>alert(document.domain)</script>
```

In other cases, HTTP response splitting may be used to send two responses to a single request by injecting the second response into the first one. A URL like the following could change the contents of a legitimate page that the target visits:

```html
application.com/redir.php?lang=hax%0d%0aContent-Length:%200%0d%0a%0d%0aHTTP/1.1%20200%20OK%d%aContent-Length:%2019%0d%0a<html>Hacked</html>
```

All the target needs to do, is visit the URL.
